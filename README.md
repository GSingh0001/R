# Refugee Movements Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and visualization of refugee movements from Asia, focusing on key countries such as Myanmar, Iraq, and Bhutan. The project includes various visualizations like choropleth maps, heatmaps, line graphs, and a dashboard, developed using R. These visualizations aim to depict the narrative of refugee movements and highlight significant geopolitical events influencing these movements.

## Project Details
**Author:** Ganga Singh  
**Institution:** Hult International Business School  
**Date:** 02-24-2024

## Executive Summary
This project includes the following key components:

1. **Visualization Process and Design Principles:**  
   - **Contrast:** Used in choropleth maps to illustrate the number of refugees.
   - **Repetition:** Consistent color schemes for better understanding.
   - **Alignment:** Strategic positioning of elements for logical flow.
   - **Proximity:** Grouping related information for clarity.

2. **Adherence to Kieran Healyâ€™s Principles:**  
   - Clear visual comparisons.
   - Context and background for data.
   - Effective data-ink ratio.
   - Simplification of complex data.

3. **Visualizations:**  
   - **Choropleth Map:** Shows the density of refugees across countries.
   - **Heatmap:** Displays migration patterns from Asia.
   - **Line Graph:** Depicts the migration rate in Myanmar over time.
   - **Dashboard:** Combines various visualizations for an interactive overview.

## Project Components
- **R Scripts:** Includes code for generating visualizations.

## Functions in R Script
### Choropleth Map
Generates a choropleth map to display the density of refugees across different countries in Asia.

### Heatmap
Creates a heatmap to visualize the migration patterns of refugees from Asia.

### Line Graph
Produces a line graph to depict the migration rate in Myanmar over time, highlighting significant geopolitical events.

### Dashboard
Combines various visualizations into an interactive dashboard for a comprehensive overview.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have R and the required libraries installed (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `shiny`, `sf`, `gapminder`, `magick`, `gifski`).
2. Run the R scripts for generating visualizations using RStudio or any R environment:
    ```R
    # Load necessary libraries
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(plotly)
    library(shiny)
    library(sf)
    library(gapminder)
    library(magick)
    library(gifski)
    
    # Run the provided R scripts for each visualization
    source('path/to/choropleth_map.R')
    source('path/to/heatmap.R')
    source('path/to/line_graph.R')
    source('path/to/dashboard.R')
    ```

## Example
Here is an example of generating a choropleth map:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

# Read and clean data
world_map <- read_sf("data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp")
refugees_raw <- read_csv("data/A2_refugee_status.csv", na = c("-", "X", "D"))

# Data cleaning and processing
refugees_clean <- refugees_raw %>%
  rename(origin_country = `Continent/Country of Nationality`) %>%
  filter(!(origin_country %in% non_countries)) %>%
  mutate(iso3 = countrycode(origin_country, "country.name", "iso3c", custom_match = c("Korea, North" = "PRK"))) %>%
  gather(year, number, -origin_country, -iso3, -origin_region, -origin_continent) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year), year_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))

# Generate choropleth map
asia_data <- refugees_clean %>%
  filter(origin_continent == "Asia") %>%
  group_by(iso3, origin_country) %>%
  summarize(total_immigrants = sum(number))

total_immigrants_all_years <- asia_data %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>%
  summarize(Scale = sum(total_immigrants))

map_data <- left_join(world_map, total_immigrants_all_years, by = c("ISO_A3" = "iso3"))

my_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = map_data, aes(fill = Scale, text = paste(ADMIN, "<br>Total Immigrants: ", scales::comma(Scale))), color = "white", size = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Geographical Plot for Refugees Count in Asia")

# Convert ggplot to plotly for interactivity
my_plotly <- ggplotly(my_plot, tooltip = "text")
my_plotly
```

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the refugee crisis in Asia, highlighting the significant contributions refugees can make to host countries. The visualizations offer a clear and impactful way to understand refugee movements and the underlying geopolitical factors.

Feel free to explore the R scripts and reach out with any questions or feedback.
